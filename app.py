# Explanation of the Application
st.write("""
    **Welcome to the Earnings Power Monitor!** ðŸš€ 

    This interactive application is designed to help you understand a company's earnings power by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs). 
    It's a tool for fundamental analysts to quickly assess financial health and future prospects. 
    This lab uses synthetic data to demonstrate data handling and visualization techniques, making complex financial analysis accessible and engaging.

    **Course Context**: This application aligns with the concepts discussed in the **'Data Science for Long-Term Investment Decisions'** chapter of the *AI and Big Data in Investments* course (Module 3), particularly slide 12, which emphasizes long-term earnings power. 
    Here, we operationalize those concepts by enabling you to interactively explore KPIs and benchmark company performance.

    Let's dive in and explore the earnings power! 
    Use the dropdown menus and interactive charts below to analyze different KPIs and compare companies. 
    Hover over data points and chart elements for detailed explanations and insights.

Select a KPI from the dropdown to visualize its trend over time and compare it against industry peers. 
**KPIs available:**
- **Revenue Growth**: Indicates the percentage increase in a company's sales over a period. A higher growth rate often suggests strong market demand and business expansion.
- **Operating Margin**: Represents the percentage of revenue remaining after deducting operating expenses. A higher margin indicates efficient cost management and profitability from core operations.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Measures how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. A higher ROE suggests effective use of shareholder investments to generate profits.

It uses a basic weighted average approach for illustrative purposes.

**Formula (Simplified):**
- Score = (KPI Value Percentile Rank among peers + (Year-over-year KPI Growth) ) / 2

**Interpretation:**
- Higher score generally indicates stronger earnings power.
- Use this score as a starting point for further in-depth analysis.
